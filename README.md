  ## Description
  I created this project to quickly and efficiently generate README markdown files for Github project repositories. I was motivated to create this to make one of the most important parts of the development process quicker and easier. I believe in working smarter and harder and I believe this project lives up to that. Creating a README can be a little tedious and the automation of this tool makes the process more fun. Through this project I learned how powerful and helpful Inquirer can be and it has encouraged me to use it for future projects. 

  ## Installation
  This application can only run in a text editor like Visual Studio Code.
